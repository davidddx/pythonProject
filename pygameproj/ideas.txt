add archetypes that plr can choose in the beginning of game
add abilities with cooldown for the future
archetype ideas:
    glide = player can double jump, is less affected by gravity, fast in air, and jumps slightly higher than average, but is very slow on ground, has 3 health
    athlete = player can move slightly faster than average and jumps slightly higher than average, has 3 health
    ninja = player is extremely fast with high jump and can double jump, but has 1 health
    tank = player is slightly slow and jumps slightly lower than average, but cannot die to enemies
    all-rounder = player does everything average
